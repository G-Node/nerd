### Nerd Project - mapping between odml file format and nosql database (mongodb)

**prototype** directory contains my first attempt to make that mapping 
(next will be done from scratch, based on git object model)

**mongodb_implementation** directory has version, which tries to implement data model similar to that used in git, using mongodb document database.

**couch_implementation** directory contains the same solution, implemented using CouchDB database.

**orientdb_implementation** uses graph-document database to provide solution for odml <-> database mapping.
